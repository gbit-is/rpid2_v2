### rpid2_v2
The [original](https://github.com/gbit-is/rpid2) RPI-D2 project was a bit of a mess, starting from scratch

### Somewhat almost ready features

- Use any* usb gamepad controller for main motors and dome
- handles audio, manual audio triggers and automatic generation **
- web interface for controlling various parameters **
- Drop-in dome positioning system (no modifications needed to the mrbaddeley V3 body) ***
- automatic dome homing ****
- automatic dome roaming ****



\* okay, not any controller, I have tried 4 and 3 worked (I think the forth one was simply broken though)   
\** Existing in version 1, plan on at least partially rewriting it for version 2    
\*** Still a work in progress, proof of concept has been created but needs some polishing before publishing  
\**** Not started on this part 

### Parts list:

Main control:
- Gamepad: Any-ish gamepad with a USB reciever
- Raspberry pi: I am using a raspberry pi 3B without issue

Motor control:
- Any PWM motor controller should work, I am using 2X cytron md30c (chosen for price and avaivability)
- Raspberry Pi Pico (or any other board capable of running circuitpython, has usb_cdc support and at least 4 digital pins)

Dome control:
- Raspberry Pi Pico (I would not recomend using other boards for this, the libraries used here can be more of a hazzle)
- logic level shifter with at least 3 channels
- Hall effect sensor ( I am using the LJ18A3-8-Z/BX )
- Large rotary encoder ( I am using the 38S6G5-B-G24N ( 50 step version) which gives me a resolution of roughly 0.4Â°)
